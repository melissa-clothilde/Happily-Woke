# Happily Woke

## About

A news app that provides up-to-date news filtered by a positive, neutral, and/or negative mood based on user choice. News API and Vader Sentiment combine to help all users to strive for balance when it comes staying informed and prioritizing our emotional and mental health.


## Role

In creating this group project, I designed the user interface, contributed to link the Vader Sentiment Analyzer to news headlines, and coded the News API backend routes for successful deployment.
